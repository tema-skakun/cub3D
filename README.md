## Group Project
  - Mohamed Meredith  - ray casting and elimination of the collision wall;
  - Artem Skakun      - ray casting and parsing map files.

## Overview

This project is inspired by the world famous 3D game Wolfenstein, which was the first first person shooter. While doing this project we studied raycasting. We created a pseudo three-dimensional dynamic game with a first-person view in which you have to find your way in a maze.
